This is a library useful for controlling HD44780-based LCD displays. Normally I would have used pfleury's nice
library, but for some reason my LCD display did not seem to work with it. Arduino's LiquidCrystal worked for me,
but I prefer working in pure C, so I had to find another library. This one is a result - note that I have edited it
to suit my needs (shortened function names, general clean-up, etc.)
